Running the program will present the main menu.

From the main menu, you can select to enter new account info, or view the current account info list.

![enter info](https://github.com/nhoersch7/Account-Manager/blob/master/Readme_images/username%20enter.png?raw=true)

Choosing to enter a new account info, will give you three prompts: 
    - Enter a new account type/name
    - Enter a new account username
    - Enter a new account password
    
After entering the account info, press yes to save, no to try again, or cancel to stop entering the info.

Choosing to view the account list, will show the list of accounts as well as the login info for each one.

Pressing okay will take you back to the main menu.

Pressing the x in the upper right corner, will close the program.

The account info is stored in progfile.txt in the same directory as the program file itself. The account-info list should stay updated with new info after program use, and should remain updated.
